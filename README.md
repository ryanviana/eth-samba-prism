## 🤖 Stable Diffusion Integration: Current Strategy & Future Vision

### Current Implementation

Currently, our platform incorporates a cutting-edge application of stable-diffusion technology, albeit through a paid product not fully tailored to our specific needs. Here's how the process unfolds:

- **📝 Prompt Submission**: Users input their design idea into our system.
- **🔗 Proof-of-Inspiration Contract**: This contract records the user's prompt.
- **🛠️ Stable-Diffusion API Interaction**: Leveraging Chainlink function calls, the system communicates with the stable-diffusion API to generate the design.
- **🗃️ Image & Hash Management**: The resulting image is stored in our file management system, and a hash of the image is generated.
- **📊 Mapping Structure Storage**: The original prompt and the image hash are stored together, establishing a verifiable link between the inspiration and the generated image.

### Future Vision

#### Enhanced Model Training & Open-Source Accessibility

- **👩‍🔬 Model Development**: We plan to develop and train our model to tailor it precisely to our platform's requirements. Post-development, the model will be made open-source, enabling public verification of our image processing techniques based on user prompts.
- **🎛️ Advanced User Interface**: Drawing inspiration from user-friendly frameworks like Fooocus ([Fooocus Stable Diffusion UI](https://easywithai.com/stable-diffusion-ui/fooocus/)), we aim to offer an interface that provides extensive customization options. Users will have the ability to adjust a wide range of parameters, fostering greater creativity in design generation.

#### Tailored Design Generation

- **👕 T-Shirt Design Focus**: Our models will undergo specific training to optimize the generation of t-shirt designs that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also suitable for manufacturing, based on user inputs.
- **⚙️ Manufacturing Parameters Integration**: In addition to design aesthetics, the model will consider optimal manufacturing parameters to ensure that designs are ready for production, enhancing the bridge between digital creativity and physical merchandise.

By advancing in these directions, our platform seeks to empower users with the tools to bring their creative visions to life while ensuring a seamless transition from digital designs to tangible products.


### Conclusion
Our project is at the forefront of combining machine learning with fashion design, creating a unique platform for personalized apparel. As we continue to develop and refine our technology, we aim to offer users an unparalleled ability to bring their creative visions to life, whether through owning a unique piece of wearable art or by stepping into the role of a designer in the digital marketplace.
